# Eye-Operated-Cursor

Language: Python
Modules: cv2
         mediapipe
         pyautogui

This is a Python based ML project.
In this project we are creating an eye operated cursor using CV2 and Mediapipe module.

Working:
Right Eye is used to move the cursor accross the screen
	User can also move their camera/webcam around (if possible) to cover the larger area of screen.

Left eye is for performing left click. User can perform the click by winking/blinking.

Works better under better and bright lighting. User should have an external light souce in front of face for a better control over functionality
